## Hints
- While not explicitly required, functions will be your friend.
- The library `<cctype>` may come in handy.
- Get the full song to print first without worrying about the `*` or writing `Bingo`. Then worry about the `*`. Then worry about `Bingo`.

## Reminders
- Name your file *wsuid*\_hw05.cpp
- You are required to place a comment block at the top of the file. Refer to the Coding Guidelines
handout.
